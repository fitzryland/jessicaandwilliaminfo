<p>As you can see, the Hotel Provincial is a mere four blocks from the Montague House. We suggest walking to the Ceremony and stumbling back to the Hotel for the After Party. Hotel Provincial has a large parking lot for your convenience; please leave your car parked during the festivities.</p>

<p>Not staying at Hotel Provincial?</p>

<p>There is very limited parking in the French Quarter and you may not feel like driving home after the Reception. We suggest taking a cab or the streetcar.</p>

<p>Cab: Flag one down; tell ‘em you’re headed to Royal and Orleans; sit back.</p>

<p>Streetcar: The St. Charles Avenue Line ends at Canal Street. From there, St. Charles turns into Royal Street once you cross Canal Street, so just keep on walking down Royal about 6 blocks to the Montague House (731 Royal Street).</p>

<p>The Canal Street Line stops at Carondolet Street, which is one block away from Royal. Hop off at Carondolet, saunter on over to Royal, and strut down those 6 blocks to the Montague House.</p>
